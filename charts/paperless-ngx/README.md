Paperless-ngx is a community-supported open-source document management system that transforms your physical documents
into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, less paper. Paperless-NGX is the official successor to the
original [Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless) & [Paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng)
projects and is designed to distribute the responsibility of advancing and supporting the project among a team of
people. The application organizes and indexes your documents with tags, correspondents, types and more, performs OCR on
your documents, making their text searchable and selectable and due its' use of the Tesseract engine - recognizes more
than 100 languages. On top of all that it features a beautiful modern web application and is accompanied by a plethora
of mobile applications for iOS and Android, provided by the open-source community around the project. It delivers all of
these features within a single Docker image available
on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/pkgs/container/paperless-ngx).

## ✨ TL;DR

__Helm Repository Installation__

```shell
helm repo add fmjstudios https://fmjstudios.github.io/helm
helm install paperless-ngx fmjstudios/paperless-ngx --version 0.1.2
```

__OCI Installation__

```shell
helm install oci://ghcr.io/fmjstudios/helm/paperless-ngx:0.1.2
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a
Paperless-NGX [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) on
a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager. For cluster networking
a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
and [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) manifest is also created, whereas the
Ingress needs to be explicitly enabled. Lastly the chart configures
a [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) if
enabled. [RBAC manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) are enabled by default.

The chart supports the configuration of
all [Paperless-NGX environment variables](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/configuration/) via the `paperless` key in
Helm's _values_ and makes use of the official Docker Hub container image, although this is configurable via the Image
Parameters.
