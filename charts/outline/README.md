> This Helm chart relies on the open-source _Bitnami_ Helm charts `postgresql` and `redis`. Beginning on August 28th, 2025, _Bitnami_
> (_VMware_/_Broadcom_) has changed their public offering and will require a commercial license for the use of their charts and images
> (_Bitnami Secure Images_/_BSI_). The only images available to the public as of now are a small set of hardened images which are only
> available at the 'latest' tag and meant for testing and development purposes. As such, the PostgreSQL and Redis subcharts included in
> this Helm chart are provided for convenience, but users are encouraged to use their own instances, another Helm chart, or (preferably)
> Operator-managed instances like CloudNativePG, if they do not wish to obtain a Bitnami license.

Outline is a fast, collaborative, open-source knowledge base for your team. It combines a distraction-free markdown
editor with a well-organized structure for documents, wikis and knowledge sharing, real-time collaborative editing,
and integrations with tools like Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Figma and Notion. As an open-source project, Outline is
freely available for self-hosting.

It delivers all of these features within a single Docker image available
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/outlinewiki/outline).

## ✨ TL;DR

### Helm Repository Installation

```shell
helm repo add adnoctem https://adnoctem.github.io/charts
helm install outline adnoctem/outline --version X.Y.Z
```

### OCI Installation

```shell
helm install oci://ghcr.io/adnoctem/charts/outline:X.Y.Z
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps an
Outline [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
or [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager. For cluster
networking a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
and [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) manifest is also created, whereas the
Ingress needs to be explicitly enabled. Lastly the chart configures
a [PodDisruptionBudget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) if
enabled. [RBAC manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) are enabled by default.

The chart models every setting documented in
Outline's own [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/outline/outline/blob/main/.env.sample) as a dedicated,
typed `values.yaml` field under the `outline` key - database, Redis, file storage (local or S3-compatible), SMTP,
rate limiting, and every sign-in provider and third-party integration Outline supports each get their own values
section, rather than a generic environment-variable passthrough. See the Parameters tables below for the full
list.

> [!NOTE]
> Outline's official Docker Compose quick-start additionally runs [`steveltn/https-portal`](https://github.com/steveltn/https-portal)
> in front of the application, to get automatic Let's Encrypt HTTPS for a bare Compose stack. This chart doesn't need
> it - TLS termination and certificate management are handled by the cluster's own Ingress controller
> and [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/), which is why this chart has no equivalent component.

## Upgrading

### To 0.1.2 (Outline 1.10.0 -> 1.10.1)

[Outline 1.10.1](https://github.com/outline/outline/releases/tag/v1.10.1) adds WebMCP support and Open Knowledge
Format (OKF) export, improves document query performance, and fixes authentication, API key scope validation and
editor behavior. The upstream environment reference and container configuration are unchanged; existing chart
values remain compatible.

Two database migrations narrow the document-search update trigger and add indexes to user-reference columns in
`documents`, `revisions` and `events`. Outline runs these automatically during startup with this chart's default
container command. Allow time for the index creation on larger databases when choosing the Helm upgrade timeout
and, if enabled, the startup probe's failure threshold.
