# Commit Message Format

This specification is inspired by and supersedes the **AngularJS commit message format**.

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted.
This format leads to **easier to read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```html

<header>
    <BLANK LINE>
        <body>
        <BLANK LINE>
            <footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the [Commit Message Header](#commit-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except for those of type "docs".
When the body is present it must be at least 20 characters long and must conform to
the [Commit Message Body](#commit-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-footer) format describes what the footer is used for and
the structure it must have.

#### <a name="commit-header"></a>Commit Message Header

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: charts|make|scripts|docs
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

##### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: New features
* **fix**: Bug fixes
* **docs**: Documentation changes
* **refactor**: Code changes which neither add features nor fix bugs
* **test**: Adding tests or improving upon existing tests
* **chore**: Miscellaneous maintenance tasks which can generally be ignored
* **build**: Changes or improvements to the build system or to the projects dependencies (_supported Scopes_: `make`)
* **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (_supported Scopes_: `actions`)

##### Scopes

The following is the list of supported scopes:

* `charts` - Changes affecting a multitude of charts at once
* `charts/*` - Changes affecting single charts
* `k8s` - Changes to Kubernetes manifests (development setup)
* `make` - Changes affecting the Make-based build system
* `scripts` - Changes to scripts
* `config` - Changes to configuration files

##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

#### <a name="commit-body"></a>Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain _why_ you are
making the change.
You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate the impact of the
change.

#### <a name="commit-footer"></a>Commit Message Footer

The footer can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations and is also the place to reference GitHub
issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to.
For example:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

or

```
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>
<BLANK LINE>
<deprecation description + recommended update path>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Closes #<pr number>
```

Breaking Change section should start with the phrase "BREAKING CHANGE: " followed by a summary of the breaking change, a
blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

Similarly, a Deprecation section should start with "DEPRECATED: " followed by a short description of what is deprecated,
a blank line, and a detailed description of the deprecation that also mentions the recommended update path.

### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

* information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
* a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
